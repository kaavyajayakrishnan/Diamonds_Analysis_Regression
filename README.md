# Diamonds_Analysis_Regression
# Problem Statement 
This famous dataset includes the pricing and other characteristics of about 54,000 diamonds. It's an excellent dataset for those who are just starting out with data analysis and visualisation. Here I am using two regression models, namely Linear regression and Random Forest Regression.
## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Diamond Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds) from (Kaggle). Using the given features such as clarity, color and cut of the diamonds, we predict/estimate its price.

## Models Used
1. Random Forest Regression:
A Random Forest Regression model is effective and precise. It typically succeeds on a wide range of problems, including those with non-linear relationships. However the  disadvantages are as follows: there is no interpretability and overfitting is possible. During training, a Random Forest constructs many decision trees and outputs the mean of the classes as the prediction of all the trees.

2. Linear Regression
Learning a linear regression model involves estimating the values of the coefficients used in the representation using the given data.When only one input variable (x) is present, the procedure is known as simple linear regression. When there are many input variables, the approach is  referred to as multiple linear regression.

## Future Work
1. Given more data/trends in prices of diamonds based on the features mentioned for each type of diamond, we will be able to predict its price 10 years hence.
2. Datas such as mode of payment/investment can be predicted based on the price range.
